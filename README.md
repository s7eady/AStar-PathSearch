# AStar-PathSearch
Using A* algorithm to path find through obstacles

A Year 2 Semester 2 Project by me!
To find the shortest path between the Start and Target while avoiding obstacles using A* Search Algorithm

### Attached to this repository are as follows:
- AStar.ipynb, source code
- map.txt, .txt file containing the map
- Guide.pdf, guidebook for those who want to learn about A* Search and code from scratch (I did it this way!)
